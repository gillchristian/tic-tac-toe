# React/Redux Tic-Tac-Toe

This project was bootstraped with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Motivation

This is a very simple project made to showcase the differences between [`<styled-components />`](http://styled-components.github.io/) and [`{ glamorous
}`](https://github.com/paypal/glamorous). At the moment it only consists of a few components making up one view being server side rendered.

- [styled-components version page](https://gillchristian.xyz/tic-tac-toe).
- [glamorous version page](https://gillchristian.xyz/tic-tac-toe-glam).
